CT60A4160 Fundamentals of Software Testing

**General Description**

Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do. The benefits of testing include preventing bugs, reducing development costs, and improving performance.

**History of Software Testing**

Software testing arrived alongside the development of software, which had its beginnings just after the second world war. Computer scientist Tom Kilburn is credited with writing the first piece of software, which debuted on June 21, 1948, at the University of Manchester in England. It performed mathematical calculations using machine code instructions.

Debugging was the main testing method at the time and remained so for the next two decades. By the 1980s, development teams looked beyond isolating and fixing software bugs to testing applications in real-world settings. It set the stage for a broader view of testing, which encompassed a quality assurance process that was part of the software development life cycle. In the 1990s, there was a transition from testing to a more comprehensive process called quality assurance, which covers the entire software development cycle and affects the processes of planning, design, creation and execution of test cases, support for existing test cases and test environments,” says Alexander Yaroshko in his post on the uTest developer site.

Testing had reached a qualitatively new level, which led to the further development of methodologies, the emergence of powerful tools for managing the testing process and test automation tools.

**Course Content**

The course is focused at building a deep understanding of the concept of Software Quality Assurance while enabling the students to be able to:

Understand phases of software testing

Understand testing automating

Be able to understand testing tools and being a part of a testing team.

You Are Not Done Yet - a compendium of ideas for testing softwareVerkko-osoite

In this document a tester gives his insight on what should be tested. The list is long but it gives one an idea on what to test when one thinks that "all is now tested", which of course is not the case.

### Final Project Presentation

Points= 6(20%)  

Record the presentation considering the following contents:
     1 -small introduction of your project
     2 -Test cases you have conducted
     3 -Bugs that have been found (if any)
     4 -Final conclusion of the project (What is the overall state of the project?, How well was your testing? What improvement would still be needed).

Submission of course project  
Submit only one PDF-file.  
Group submits only once.

Presentation    
Formation of groups to return the practical assignment / course projectRyhmänmuodostus
The course project is done in a group of five students. If no fifth person is found four students can work together.

### Literature Report  
The literature review provides a review of the relevant contributions from the existing body of literature. This task aims to understand the state-of-the-art research conducted in the domain of software testing. This is a group task (5 people) and you can go with the same group formed for the final project.

Three papers are uploaded, and you need to write a summary of each section of the papers, including the research gap (future work).  (total  9 points, 3  point per each paper)
